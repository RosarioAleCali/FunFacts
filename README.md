# FunFacts

Fun Facts is an App I developed following an introductory course on Team Treehouse about Android App Development.
As an introductory course the app itself is very simple but it teaches concepts and techniques about
developing an Android App that are a lot used in Apps that follow Google's guidelines.

A few things that I have learnt are:
* Using Android Studio and its AVD Manager tool.
* The basics of sreen layouts.
* Android Views and Activities.
* Use Java and the principles of OOP to change the state of Android objects.
* Create and Modify Components of a View by using the GUI Editor and the XML Language.
* Create a listener on a button.
* Use string resources instead of traditional strings.
